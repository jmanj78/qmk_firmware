# joshea's Iris rev4 layout

## Feature overview
- Dual rotary encoders at thumb keys
- Limited RGB backlight animations to the less crazy ones
- Tap dance and some simple macros
- Made with Javascript/Web development in mind

## Default layer (QWERTY)
Alphas are the same as the default QWERTY layout, but the numbers (top row) I replaced with common functions, as I found I use the "numpad" for numbers more efficiently.

Left shift is Shift when held, Caps when tapped.

Tap dance is used for the `;` key, which is the normal `;` on one click, and `End + ;` on two in succession. Makes adding those semicolons to the end of your program lines quicker.

Middle thumb keys are `Space` when tapped, and momentary layer switches when held.

Left rotary is for volume, mute when pressed.

Right rotary is PgUp/PgDwn when rotated. When pressed it sends `Ins+Q`, which is the shortcut to exit the NVDA screen reader software.
